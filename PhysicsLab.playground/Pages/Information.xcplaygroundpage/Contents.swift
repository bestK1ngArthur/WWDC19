 # Physics Lab:

This playground allows you to create and simulate various physical experiments. For the demonstration, I created a virtual physical experiment to obtain Lissajous figures.
 
 #### Jules Antoine Lissajous was a French physicist who investigated the trajectories drawn by a point, performing simultaneously two harmonic oscillations in two mutually perpendicular directions

 ### Inspiration
 
We were told about the Lissajous figures at the university, but I could not understand how they could be obtained. I needed someone to show a demonstration. Therefore, I decided to create this virtual physic laboratory and conduct the experiment to obtain Lissajous figures.
 
 ### Resources
 
 I calculated the physical algorithm myself. For this I had to remember the course of school physics.
 
 In the program, I did not use any third-party libraries. All UI elements (such as springs) are drawn using only the UIKit framework.
 
 I took the free icons from the site [icons8.com](icons8.com)

 # Features
 
 ## 🧭 Real time simulation
 
To start the simulation you need to click on play button. At any time, you can click on stop button to stop the experiment.
 
 ## 🧹 Clear the canvas
 
 At any time you can click on clear the button to clear the experiment canvas.
 
 ## 💾 Save the results
 
 You can save the results of the experiment. To do this, you need to click on the camera button and a screenshot of the canvas will be saved to "~/Documents/Shared Playground Data".
 
 #### Attention! You need to create a directory \"~/Documents/Shared Playground Data\" before using screenshot feature

 # What for?
 
 My virtual lab can be used to demonstrate various physical experiments to schoolchildren or students in order to understand them better. This program allows you to write and add your experiments following the experiment protocol.
